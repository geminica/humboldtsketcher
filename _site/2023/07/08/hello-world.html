<p>Am I starting a new blog again? In the 90s I kept a manual “online journal” by writing out each page in HTML. Eventually my focus switched to livejournal, flickr, twitter,and other social media platforms. I’m not sure what room there is for a personal blog at this point, but… maybe we’ll see.</p>
