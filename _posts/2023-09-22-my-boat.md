When I revisited Scotland in 2011, I found it frustrating that so much tourism had been recast to focus on Harry Potter.  Scotland is old and alive and full of wonder, and Harry Potter is just Harry Potter. 

It was as if someone tried to introduce me to my own sister, who means so much to me that I'd have to write a novel to tell you about her, by saying "she's important because she's got a cool stripey scarf."

When I visited Scotland again in 2022, the same was true about Outlander.  C'mon folks. You don't need to remind me that some upstart tv show has Scotland in it, for me to love this place. When it comes to Scotland I've got memories wrapped in fantasies wrapped in drunken stupors wrapped in half-remembered dreams. Outlander is fine, and who doesn't love the eye candy, but it's way too late to sell me "Scotland as seen in Outlander".

All that as precursor to say, the ship I'll be on as guest crew next summer is actually featured in Outlander, and I can't deny I feel proud of that connection nonetheless  :-D :-D :-D

I'm ridiculous.

THAT'S MA'BOAT THERE
