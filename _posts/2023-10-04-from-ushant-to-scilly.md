There are two specific and perhaps unusual practices I engage in while travelling, that connect me to a place and let me feel myself to be part of the grand history of the world.

There's sketching, as you know.

But also, I sing.

It generally isn't planned. I'm not great at it, and I do it only for myself. But it's fun to learn songs, and natural to seek out songs about places that hold personal interest. When I finally make it to a place I've long yearned to see, there's a song on my lips to gift to it.

I've sung "I'm in a New York state of mind" while hoofing it on the streets of Manhattan. I've fumbled through "Rocky Road to Dublin" on a tin whistle from the banks of the Liffey. And I've sung odes to Prince Charlie Stuart from the marshy trails around Loch Shiel, where he gathered the clans for the ill-fated trek to Culloden.

> If you had seen my Charlie at the head of an army  
> He was a gallant sight to behold  
> With his fine tartan hose and his bonnie round leg  
> And his buckles all a pure shining gold

Both sketching and singing are offerings that can bind me to a place. For most of us, when we take photos, there's a fair chance we're not deeply investing in the moment. Our focus, as it were, is not deep or intense, but scattered and faulty. Taking a photo doesn't give me a sense that the place belongs to me. Sketching does. I let the place in through my senses, and I gift it with my whole attention and all my love for beauty, and when I walk way it's part of me.

When I sing a song while in the place that inspired it, I feel that whoever wrote that song is right there with me, separated only by time, which hardly matters. And all the others who have loved this place and sung this song are related to me not by bloodlines but through something weirder and deeper - like we're the blood kin of those hills and that loch, and the blood is made of song and story and ink.

We have the power to eschew the crowds, put away the phone, wander along an abandoned trail, and bond ourselves to a place in a way that will stick with us forever. And all it takes is paper, pen, and a song.

I'm starting to learn the 18th century naval song _Spanish Ladies_, as the perfect accompaniment for crossing the English Channel by tall ship next summer. I'm sure to see Ushant, and perhaps Scilly as well!

>Farewell and adieu, to you Spanish ladies  
Farewell and adieu, to you ladies of Spain  
For we've received orders  
For to sail for Old England  
But we hope, very soon, we shall see you again  
>
>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors  
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas  
Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England  
From Ushant to Scilly is 35 leagues  
>
>We hove our ship to, with the wind at Sou'west boys  
We hove our ship to, our soundings to see  
We rounded and sounded got 45 fathoms  
Then we squared our main yard and up channel steered we  
>
>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors  
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas  
Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England  
From Ushant to Scilly is 35 leagues  
>
>The next land we made  't was called "The Deadman"  
Next Rams Head off Plymouth, off Portland and Wight  
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlee and Dungeness  
'Till we came abreast of the south foreland light  
>
>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors  
>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas  
>Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England  
>From Ushant to Scilly is 35 leagues  
>
>Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor  
>All in the Downs that night for to lie  
>Then it's stand by your stoppers, steer clear your shank-painters  
>Haul up your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly  
>
>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors  
>We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas  
>Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England  
>From Ushant to Scilly is 35 leagues  
>
>So let every man toss off a full bumper  
>And let every man drink of a full glass  
>We'll drink and be merry and drown melancholy  
>Singing, here's a good health to each true-hearted lass  
>
>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors  
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas  
Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England  
From Ushant to Scilly is 35 leagues
