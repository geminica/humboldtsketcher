In preparation for sketching a boatload of boats next year, I'm looking for inspiration and ideas. How will I capture the event in the moments I can grab here and there? I could use more strategies for dealing with maritime scenes.

My intent while sailing will be to focus on quick impressions - gestures rather than complexity, mood rather than accuracy. That way I can float around making sketches without having to withdraw for long from being an active participant in the sailing and festivities.

Here are a few samples that I'd like to practice emulating.

First off, I always love Van Gogh's line work. It's the fact that he keeps the soul of the linework when reproducing in paint that makes his paintings so compelling.

These two sketches from Turner are remarkably different from each other. Note his shapes are very simple; the important touches are the values and the minimal touches of detail that convince your eye it knows what it's seeing.

Here's a modern sketch by the inimitable Lapin. I can't make this kind of tidy line and accuracy happen but wow, what glimmering colors, what a light touch to the lines to show the complexity of the shape without making the drawing messy or overwraught.

These James McNeill Whistler art styles are a little more complex and maybe not great inspiration for quick sketches, but the lines are graceful and the colors harmonious in a way that I'd like to learn from.

My search continues, and I'll start sharing some experiments soon.
