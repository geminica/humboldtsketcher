It's way too late to sell me Scotland as romanticized by Outlander.

Just as it was too late to sell me Scotland as romanticized by Harry Potter, a decade ago. I went to Glenfinnan to see the Jacobite Steam Train, not the Hogwarts Express.

Being the target of the relentless marketing around these fandoms feels very awkward. 

On my last visit in 2022, I happened to visit Inverness. Outlander was mentioned or referenced in marketing dozens of times. People brought it up in conversation repeatedly. I started to resent being expected to be interested in the place just for its presentation of a specific fantasy.

When it comes to Scotland I've got memories wrapped in fantasies wrapped in drunken singing on the streets of Glasgow. There are people there that I care about. One of them wears a kilt. One is my boss. I'm still just a tourist there, but my crazy intense feelings about the place are way past the initial glamour and the stereotypes.

All that as precursor to say, the ship I'll be on as guest crew next summer is actually featured in Outlander, and I can't deny I feel proud of that connection :-D :-D :-D

I'm ridiculous.

But DAT'S MA'BOAT, as spotted during Outlander S7 filming.

:heart: :heart: :heart:

Maybe I'm still just a goofy romantic after all.
