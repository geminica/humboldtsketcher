It's way too late to sell me Scotland as romanticized by Outlander. When it comes to Scotland I've got memories wrapped in fantasies wrapped in drunken singing on the streets of Glasgow. There are people there that I care about. One of them wears a kilt. One is my boss. I'm still just a tourist there, but my crazy intense feelings about the place are way past the initial glamour and the stereotypes.

All that as precursor to say, the ship I'll be on as guest crew next summer is actually featured in Outlander, and I can't deny I feel proud of that connection :-D :-D :-D

I'm ridiculous.

But DAT'S MA'BOAT, as spotted during Outlander S7 filming.

:heart: :heart: :heart:

Maybe I'm still just a goofy romantic after all.
